# Project Introduction

This project is part of the requirements for the Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program, by Udacity.

The goal of this project is to provide practice with:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

This project is a web tool that allows users to run NLP (Natural Language Processing) on articles or blogs found on other websites, being able to analyse the sentiment of the information available in the source.
It uses **"MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API"**, an external WebAPI that provides such information.

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
> concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
> process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.
